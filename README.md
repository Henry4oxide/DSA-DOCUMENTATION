### PROJECT TOPIC: ENHANCING FOOD SAFETY BY MINIMIZING FILTER PAPER EXPOSURE AND CONTAMINATION RISKS ON MACHINE 543 & 544 IN DRY POWDER FACTORY (TOPTEA)

### PROJECT OVERVIEW: Importance of Hygiene in Tea Manufacturing
Food safety is a critical aspect of tea manufacturing, ensuring that products meet industry standards and consumer expectations. The filter paper, a vital component of the production process, is responsible for handling and transferring tea materials. However, without proper protective coverings, filter paper become highly susceptible to environmental contamination from dust, airborne microbes, and other particles ( see appendices).

### PROCEJECT SCOPE
The primary goal of this project is to design, fabricate, and install protective overs for filter paper to prevent contamination. [see video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F40Y-_rXMic&list=PLVlVLJaOlit7cuPJKp9Ky7ps2yJnt8Ays&index=1&pp=iAQB) covers for filter paper to prevent contamination.
This project will focus on:
- Conducting a contamination risk assessment [download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  - by carrying out process audit
  - creating checklist for operatives
  - providing SOPs for production spervisor
- Designing protective covers that do not interfere with machine efficiency.
- Selecting food-grade, non-toxic, and easy-to-clean materials for the covers.
- Installing the covers on all filter paper machines in the facility.
- Establishing a routine maintenance program to ensure continued effectiveness.
- Training employees on hygiene best practices and the importance of protective covers.

### PROJECT PROTOCOL
A structured implementation plan is essential to ensure project success. The following steps will be followed:
1. Assessment of Current Contamination Risks – Conduct site surveys and microbiological tests.
2. Design and Development of Protective Covers – Create designs that provide full coverage while allowing proper ventilation.
3. Material Selection – Use food-safe, durable, and easy-to-clean materials.
4. Installation and Testing – Fit covers onto machines and conduct effectiveness tests.
5. Monitoring and Maintenance – Establish a cleaning schedule and inspection plan.
